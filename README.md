# 4.4 - Fieldset, legend tags

## Overview
In this lab, you will Modify the **Student Profile Form** from 4.3
You will add in fieldsets and patterns.

By the end of this lab, your webpage will:
- Collect information from a form
- Respond to a button click
- Display a personalized message without reloading the page
  
## 1. Fieldset Tag
- find each of the h3 tags that serve as headings for each section of inputs
- put each section of inputs into a `<fieldset>` tag, and use the `<legend>` tag to make the heading instead of the h3 tag
- there should be one for `Personal Information`, `Grade Level`, and `Interests`

## 2. Pattern Attribute
- find the phone number and state code inputs in the `Peronsal Information` fieldset
- what pattern do phone numbers follow? ex: 718-123-9876
- what pattern do state codes follow? ex: NY, CA, MD
- add the `pattern` attribute along with the correct pattern code for each of these inputs.
